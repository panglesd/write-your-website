# write-your-website

Example [here](https://paulelliot.anglesdauriac.fr)

To create your own:

* clone the project
* open `index.html` in a browser
* add `?modify` at the end of the URL
* ask for documentation or figure out yourself how to create your website (example [here](https://paulelliot.anglesdauriac.fr?modify))
* click `save` and save the file on the same folder as `index.html`
* modify the line 483 of `index.html` to specify the pages you want to draw when loading
* Put everything to be served by a *server* (a server is needed to low the json file)
